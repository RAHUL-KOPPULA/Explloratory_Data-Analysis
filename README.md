📊 _Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Titanic Dataset_
📁 #Project Overview
This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic Dataset to extract meaningful insights using visual and statistical methods.

The analysis aims to:

Identify patterns, trends, and anomalies.

Understand relationships between features like Age, Gender, Passenger Class, and Survival Rate.

Develop basic storytelling through data visualization.

_🛠 Tools Used_
Python

Pandas (Data manipulation)

Seaborn (Data visualization)

Matplotlib (Data visualization)

Jupyter Notebook (Analysis & Documentation)

_📋 Dataset Details_
Source: [Titanic Dataset (train.csv)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data?select=train.csv)

Columns: PassengerId, Survived, Pclass, Name, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Ticket, Fare, Cabin, Embarked

Target Variable: Survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

_📈 Key Steps Performed_
Data Loading and Inspection

Read the CSV file.

Checked the structure, missing values, and data types.

Missing Value Analysis

Identified missing data in Age, Cabin, and Embarked.

Univariate Analysis

Plotted distributions of Age, Gender, Class, and Survival.

Bivariate Analysis

Analyzed survival rates across Gender, Class, Fare, and Age.

Correlation Analysis

Generated a heatmap to visualize feature correlations.

Observations and Insights

Documented key findings after each visualization.

Summary of Findings

Noted important conclusions at the end of the analysis.

_🔥 Important Observations_
Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males.

First-class passengers had the highest survival chances.

Younger passengers and higher fare payers had better survival outcomes.

Heavy missing data was noted in the Cabin feature.
